        <p>(And How to Take It Back)</p>

        <h2>Giving Your Power Away</h2>
        <p>You are a human. And humans have this amazing power to CREATE shit. We can basically do whatever the fuck we want.</p>
        <p>In fact, it's SUCH an amazing power that religions have been trying to tame it FOREVER.</p>
        <p>"Yes, you're made in the image of god (the CREATOR), but you're supposed to just obey instead of doing what you want freely."</p>
        <p>Okay. So you're a CREATOR.</p>
        <p>You're here in this life. It's YOUR life. You have this amazing power. You can do whatever you want. You can create whatever you want.</p>
        <p>When you were a little kid, you were DOWN for that. Exploring, imagining, doing all sorts of crazy shit. Just having a great time.</p>
        <p>And then somewhere along the line, somebody told you to knock that shit off.</p>
        <p>Stop thinking about YOURSELF. About YOUR dreams. About YOUR power to create. That's selfish!</p>
        <p>Instead, you should SACRIFICE yourself for others. You should put yourself LAST.</p>
        <p>You should SHUT UP and SIT DOWN and be small and quiet and invisible. You should work for shit wages. You should settle for less than what you REALLY want. Because going for what you REALLY want is unrealistic.</p>
        <p>And so you give your power away.</p>
        <p>To other people. So THEY can be comfortable. Because THEIR comfort is more important than yours. Because for some reason YOU aren't important.</p>
        <p>Who decided that?!</p>
        <p>To ideas. That you're lazy. That you're boring. That you're a disappointment. That you're weak. That you're old. That you're broken.</p>
        <p>And to circumstances. The things going on in the world. The weather. The bank account.</p>
        <h2>Taking It Back</h2>
        <p>Taking back your power means deciding that YOU matter.</p>
        <p>It means realizing that you're in charge because it's YOUR life. It means deciding what YOU want and doing something about it.</p>
        <p>And it means believing that you CAN do something about it (because that's the ACTUAL truth).</p>
        <p>It means allowing yourself to be FREE and ADVENTURE and have fun and enjoy and be fucking THRILLED. And create whatever you can dream of.</p>
