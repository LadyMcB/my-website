        <p>(And How to Take It Back)</p>

        <h2>Who You REALLY Are</h2>
        <p>You are a human. And humans have this amazing power to CREATE shit. We can basically do whatever the fuck we want.</p>
        <p>In fact, it's SUCH an amazing power that religions have been trying to tame it FOREVER.</p>
        <p>"Yes, you're made in the image of god (the CREATOR), but you're supposed to just obey instead of living the way you were created."</p>
        <p>You are a CREATOR.</p>
        <p>With me so far? Let's keep going...</p>
        <p>So you're here in this life. It's YOUR life. You have this amazing power. You can do whatever you want. You can create whatever you want.</p>
        <p>You can create physical things. Imaginary things. Ideas. Experiences. Money. Relationships. Feelings. You can create ANYTHING.</p>
        <p>When you were a little kid, you were DOWN for that. Exploring, imagining, doing all sorts of crazy shit. Just having a great time.</p>
        <p>And then somewhere along the line, somebody told you to knock that shit off.</p>
        <h2>Giving Your Power Away</h2>
        <p> Somewhere along the line, somebody, somewhere, told you to stop thinking about YOURSELF. About YOUR dreams. About YOUR power to create.</p>
        <p>"That's selfish!" they said.</p>
        <p>Instead, said you should SACRIFICE yourself for others. You should put yourself LAST. Because THEIR comfort is more important than yours.</p>
        <p>Because for some reason YOU aren't important. For some reason, YOU don't matter.</p>
        <p>WHO DECIDED THAT?!</p>
        <p>"You've got your head in the clouds," they said.</p>
        <p>Instead, you should SHUT UP and SIT DOWN and be small and quiet and invisible. You should work for shit wages. You should settle for less than what you REALLY want. Because going for what you REALLY want isn't REALISTIC.</p>
        <p>"You'll never make it in life," they said.</p>
        <p>You should just stop trying. You're not good enough. Not attractive enough. Not smart enough.</p>
        <p>And so you give your power away.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To other people. So THEY can be comfortable. Because THEIR comfort is more important than yours.</li>
            <li>To ideas. That you're lazy. That you're boring. That you're a disappointment. That you're weak. That you're old. That you're broken.</li>
            <li>To circumstances. The things going on in the world. The weather. The bank account. Your shitty job.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You've learned you're not supposed to use your power. So now you don't. And maybe you've even forgotten that you had it in the first place.</p>
        <h2>Taking It Back</h2>
        <p>Taking your power back is simple. Not always easy, but simple. It starts with a decision.</p>
        <p>Not a wimpy "I'll try" decision. A "FUCK THIS SHIT" decision.</p>
        <p>You decide that YOU matter. Not in some abstract "everyone matters" way. YOU matter. YOU specifically. YOUR dreams. YOUR desires. YOUR life. You stop waiting for permission to want what you want.</p>
        <p>You decide YOU'RE in charge because it's YOUR life. Not your parents' life. Not your partner's life. Not your boss's life. YOURS. You get to DECIDE what you want and you get to DO something about it.</p>
        <p>And you start believing that you CAN do something about it. Because that's the ACTUAL TRUTH.</p>
        <p>You don't have to EARN the right to use your power. To shine your light. You were BORN with it.</p>
        <p>And when you actually TAKE BACK YOUR POWER and life from that place?</p>
        <p>You get to be FREE, to ADVENTURE, to have FUN and be fucking THRILLED about life. You get to create whatever you can dream of.</p>
        <p>This is YOUR life.</p>
        <p>What are you going to do with it?</p>
