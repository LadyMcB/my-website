		<h1>Thoughts</h1>
		<p>For years I thought about starting a blog, but that always seemed like a Big Thing. So one day I decided that I'd just start writing down my thoughts. No need for articles or blog posts or fully-composed anythings. Just my thoughts. If they resonate, cool. If not, oh well.</p>
