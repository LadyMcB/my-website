            <h2>Hey There! I'm Ashley.</h2>
            <p>Part numbers nerd, part cheerleader, and entirely dedicated to helping you fall in love with your money journey! With 20+ years in accounting and an MBA, I've got the technical chopsâ€”but what really lights me up is watching people transform their relationship with money.</p>
            <p>I believe financial wellness should feel goodâ€”like really good. No more money shame spirals or budget burnout. Just clarity, confidence, and maybe even some giggles along the way.<br>(Yes, budgeting can actually be fun. I promise!)</p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>Let's be realâ€”money stuff can be emotional! I bring empathy, humor, and practical wisdom to every session. We'll laugh through the awkward bits and celebrate even the tiniest wins. My philosophy blends practical accounting know-how with intuitive money coaching that honors your unique values and goals. This isn't about spreadsheets (though I do love a good spreadsheet)â€”it's about creating financial abundance that supports the life your heart truly desires.</p>

        <h2>What My Clients Are Saying</h2>
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"Honestly, I tell everyone about her any time a money conversation comes up. I know she truly cares about helping me focus on my goals. She challenges my assumptions about myself, my ability and my relationship to money in the best ways. I've never felt more confident and comfortable with my budget and spending habits. It's not just her help with getting me out of debt (almost $4k in less than 6 months) but it's the way she doesn't make me feel dumb about my questions or try to fit me into a cookie cutter mold to 'get rich.' It's always about MY goals, how I want to feel about money and what values I have. If you're looking for someone who is compassionate, person-centered, and knows what she's doing, Ashley is definitely the person for you! You won't be disappointed!"
