		<h1>Idea Library</h1>
		<p>People have ideas all the time. Those ideas mostly get left behind, unwritten and unacted upon. People say that ideas are only worth something if they're acted upon. But we all know that it's not possible to act on every idea that comes to you. So I thought it would be a good idea to write down my ideas here so that other people can see them and act on them if they want. Or I can come back someday and go, "oh yeah that looks like fun now. Let's do it."</p>
		<p>If you act on any of these ideas, let me know. I'd love to feature your creation here on this page. Send me an email: hello at ashleybarnum dot com.</p>

		<h2>The Idea List</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>create a write-up of all the bars in my hometown from a woman's perspective. which ones have a good vibe? which are safe to go to alone? which ones have the best karaoke? (if you're into that sort of thing. I am.)</li>
		</ul>
